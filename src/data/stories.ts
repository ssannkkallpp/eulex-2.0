        content: `There lived an astronomer who was very much involved in his observations. He often used to look up at the sky at night and start observing the stars. Once, as he walked looking up at the stars, his leg slipped and he fell into a ditch. He started shouting. A passer-by, who heard his shouts, helped him out of the ditch and asked, "How did you fall into this ditch?" The astronomer replied, "I was so engrossed in my observations that I did not notice the ditch". The passer-by asked, "How do you expect to discover things when you fail to take note of things under your nose?" The astronomer walked away with a sad face.`

        content: `A milkman became very wealthy through callous means. He had to cross a river daily to reach the city where his customers lived. He mixed the water of the river generously with the milk that he sold for a good profit. One day he went around collecting the dues in order to celebrate the wedding of his son. With the large amount thus collected he purchased plenty of rich clothes and glittering gold ornaments. But while crossing the river the boat capsized and all his costly purchases were swallowed by the river. The milk vendor was speechless with grief. At that time he heard a voice that came from the river, "Do not weep. What you have lost is only the illicit gains you earned through cheating your customers."`

        content: `The state of Georgia is in the midst of a major drought. Experts predict that, unless it rains cats and dogs real soon, the whole city of Atlanta will have no drinking water in four months. Lake Lanier, the source of Atlanta's water delivery system, is now at only 20 percent of its usual level. To make matters worse, when Georgia water officials tried to block the flow of the Chattahoochee River southward to Alabama and Florida, those states threatened Georgia with lawsuits. They claimed that they were just as desperate for and entitled to that river water as Georgia was. The Georgia Civil Air Patrol has been trying to seed the clouds overhead for the last six months, to no avail. State officials asked the local Cherokee Indians to do a rain dance. The Indians told them they would do a rain dance when the state returned all the land that it stole from the Cherokees. Officials hired the nation's number one water finder. He found a still for making whiskey. Finally, the governor himself held a press conference on the steps of the state capitol building. He asked all the media to bow their heads, raised his hands to heaven, and prayed. "Lord, we are asking for relief, not for us, but for the sick and the young in this state. Thank you, oh most powerful Lord". The Georgia Association of Atheists immediately sued the governor for conducting prayer sessions on state property.`

        content: `You may be surprised to learn that the humble bicycle was invented several years later than the railway locomotive! But the two-wheeler has come a long way since the day it was invented by a Scottish blacksmith, Kirkpatrick MacMillan, back (it is said) in 1839. MacMillan developed his bike from an older wheeled vehicle, called a "hobby horse". This was a wooden horse with two wheels. The rider sat on the horse, and pushed the vehicle along with his feet. It was not a very fast or safe vehicle, since it had no steering and no brakes. MacMillan, nicknamed Mad Pate, modified the hobby horse, by adding a system of articulated bars. The rider could push the bars back and forwards with his feet, and make the back wheel go round. He could also steer the bike, as the front wheel could be turned. To demonstrate his invention, he cycled 60 miles to Glasgow! It must have been a terrible journey, on the roads of the day! Pate's bike did not have rubber tyres or springs. Mad Pate was not recognised in his time, but other people became interested in bicycles. Twenty-five years later, a Frenchman called Pierre Lallemant designed and patented the first bicycle with rotary pedals; and in 1876, H.J.Lawson added another basic feature, "chain-drive". Other features, such as rubber tyres and gears, have appeared since then; but the basic bicycle has not changed. Since then the bicycle has had a magnificent fortune. Today, it is probably the most common form of transport in the world, especially in the Third World; and non-polluting and easy to ride, it has a big future as the town vehicle of tomorrow. Thanks Pate!`

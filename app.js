Experts predict that, unless it rains cats and dogs real soon, the whole city of Atlanta will have no drinking water in four months. Lake Lanier, the source of Atlanta's water delivery system, is now at only 20 percent of its usual level. To make matters worse, when Georgia water officials tried to block the flow of the Chattahoochee River southward to Alabama and Florida, those states threatened Georgia with lawsuits. They claimed that they were just as desperate for and entitled to that river water as Georgia was. The Georgia Civil Air Patrol has been trying to seed the clouds overhead for the last six months, to no avail. State officials asked the local Cherokee Indians to do a rain dance. The Indians told them they would do a rain dance when the state returned all the land that it stole from the Cherokees. Officials hired the nation's number one water finder. He found a still for making whiskey. Finally, the governor himself held a press conference on the steps of the state capitol building. He asked all the media to bow their heads, raised his hands to heaven, and prayed. "Lord, we are asking for relief, not for us, but for the sick and the young in this state. Thank you, oh most powerful Lord". The Georgia Association of Atheists immediately sued the governor for conducting prayer sessions on state property.`

But the two-wheeler has come a long way since the day it was invented by a Scottish blacksmith, Kirkpatrick MacMillan, back (it is said) in 1839. MacMillan developed his bike from an older wheeled vehicle, called a "hobby horse". This was a wooden horse with two wheels. The rider sat on the horse, and pushed the vehicle along with his feet. It was not a very fast or safe vehicle, since it had no steering and no brakes. MacMillan, nicknamed Mad Pate, modified the hobby horse, by adding a system of articulated bars. The rider could push the bars back and forwards with his feet, and make the back wheel go round. He could also steer the bike, as the front wheel could be turned. To demonstrate his invention, he cycled 60 miles to Glasgow! It must have been a terrible journey, on the roads of the day! Pate's bike did not have rubber tyres or springs. Mad Pate was not recognised in his time, but other people became interested in bicycles. Twenty-five years later, a Frenchman called Pierre Lallemant designed and patented the first bicycle with rotary pedals; and in 1876, H.J.Lawson added another basic feature, "chain-drive". Other features, such as rubber tyres and gears, have appeared since then; but the basic bicycle has not changed. Since then the bicycle has had a magnificent fortune. Today, it is probably the most common form of transport in the world, especially in the Third World; and non-polluting and easy to ride, it has a big future as the town vehicle of tomorrow. Thanks Pate!`

An ocean whose tides never seem to ebb

With many delicious bits and bytes
And even the more discerning surfer
Can google down to useful sites.

The television is not alone to blame
The internet is all the same
While the former cooked us on the couch
The latter merely makes us slouch

This might well be the age
But the medium is not the message
Said my father times umpteen
Having played his games off the screen`
